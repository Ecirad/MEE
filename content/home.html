<p>The MEE (Models in Ecology and Evolution) seminar is organized by Ph.D. students and post-docs and is targeted at young researchers (M.Sc, Ph.D. students, post-docs…) interested in theoretical approaches in Ecology and Evolution, with three major objectives:</p>
<ul>
<li>giving an overview of current modeling techniques used in ecology and evolution research: which tools for which questions?</li>
<li>create a space for exchange between different methodological approaches to identify the similarities and complementarities.</li>
<li>discuss the interest of modeling products for researchers in evolutionary ecology as for the general public.</li>
</ul>
<p>The format of the seminar is designed to promote exchanges as much as possible and consists of a series of oral presentations by visiting researchers and students.</p>
<p>Registration is free, and this year the seminar will be online.</p>
<p>Stay tuned!</p>
